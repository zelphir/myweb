I've been playing with computers for a long time! :-)

Based in London... love NodeJS/React/GraphQL/Docker/Git/Serverless!

In the past years I've worked for different companies, from startups to leading global technology companies.

I always push myself to improve the code quality and the working flow everywhere I go. Automation is very important for me, and I always try to speed up and automate as much stuff as I can, from testing tools, continuous delivery, utility tools, etc... to make other devs' lives easier and more relaxed. Trying to use serverless architecture (from different provider like AWS, Google, Azure) as much as I can.

I'm also an enthusiast photographer.
