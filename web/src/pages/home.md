I've been playing with computers for a long time! :-)

Based in London... love NodeJS/React/GraphQL/Docker/Git/Serverless!

In the past years I've worked for different companies, from startups to leading global technology companies.

I always push myself to improve the code quality and the working flow everywhere I go. Automation is very important for me, and I always try to speed up and automate as much stuff as I can, from testing tools, continuous delivery, utility tools, etc... to make other devs' lives easier and more relaxed. Trying to use serverless architecture (from different provider like AWS, Google, Azure) as much as I can.

I'm also an enthusiast photographer.

## About this website

The source code of this project is open source and you can find it in this [Github repo](https://github.com/zelphir/myweb.git) . More info on how it works in the Github [README](https://github.com/zelphir/myweb.git) or in this [blog post](/about).

In the sidebar you can see, if I'm coding, today's live stats coming from my IDE, I use **tmux+neovim**. You should see the bars moving and if you mouseover them you can see how much time I'm spending on each language.

You can also find my latest resume and some pictures taken around the world.
