I've been playing with computers for a long time! :-)

Based in London... love NodeJS/React/Docker/Git/Serverless!

I have an extensive understanding of working in an Agile environments and several years of experience. I can be a strong driving force for improving the performance, scalability and reliability of different projects. I have a long track record of creating dynamic, rich and interesting web/mobile projects. I've worked in several leading global internet technology companies.

As a self directed and self managed person I am always pushing myself to deliver ongoing process improvements in anything I do.

I'm also an enthusiast photographer.

In the sidebar you can see, if I'm coding, today's live stats coming from my IDE, I use **tmux+neovim**. You should see the bars moving and if you mouseover them you can see how much time I'm spending on each language.
