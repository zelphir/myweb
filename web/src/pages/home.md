## About this website

The source code of this project is open source and you can find it in this [Github repo](https://github.com/zelphir/myweb.git) . More info on how it works in the Github [README](https://github.com/zelphir/myweb.git) or in this [blog post](/blog).

In the sidebar you can see, if I'm coding, today's live stats coming from my IDE, I use **tmux+neovim**. You should see the bars moving and if you mouseover them you can see how much time I'm spending on each language.

You can also find my latest resume and some pictures taken around the world.
